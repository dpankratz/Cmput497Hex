# Hex

This repository contains an implementation of the game *Hex* in Unity by David Pankratz.

# Installing
 - This project was built using Unity 2018.2.20f1 which can be found [here][Unity download]. More recent versions are likely to work but the project will have to be reimported. 
 - Once Unity is installed and the repository is cloned the project can be opened by selecting *File -> Open Project* and then choosing the folder containing the repository. 
 - It is possible that the main scene will not be included by default when opening the project for the first time. To remedy this navigate to `Assets/Scenes` in the **Project** window and drag the `Domineering` scene to the **Hierarchy** window. 
 - At this point the project should be setup and can be ran by pressing the triangular run button at the top of the editor. 

# Building
 One nice feature of using Unity is that this game can be ported to a variety of platforms and behave similarly across all of them. To create a build for a given platform you can follow these instructions:
 - Open the  *File -> Build Settings...* and then click on the desired platform. 
 - Unity will likely prompt you the first time to install dependancies for building for that platform so accept and allow it to install.
 - Afterwards you should be able press the *Switch Platform* and then *Build and Run* to build.
